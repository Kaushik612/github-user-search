## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the GitHub users API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Search for GitHub users by their username
See relevant user information based on their search
Switch between light and dark themes
Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
